        1 bridge/crensdo
    config files for games, make payload/l4d2/koth.
    flow
        create flow from all team spawns (edges = zombies) to other team spawns and objectives
        prune/dont allow too far areas
        replace straight areas or add junk
        make dead ends, loops
            what if there was a party/goof off area in orange, in dead space or N/S
            or some more sideways, 5 lines, wobbly asdnjasdn idk stuff
        sniper spots/engie spots
        class specific spawn points

        mindfull of sniper sightlines
        dont make too big for lag (orange renders the whole dang map)

        PAPERS BLOWING WOULD BE AMAZING

    general decider/constrainer
        weighted based on all
            forest + spooky + alone sum score, choose random then
        urban = 25% e1m1 or 50% urban or 25% normal
        swamp = swamp fever or spooky
        forest = spooky
        rarity?
